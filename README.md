# Cyber-Security-of-IOT-by-using-RSA-Encryption-BAESd-on-Baker-Chaotic-Map
we have developed an encryption application to enhance the encryption security of data by adopting innovative cryptographic methods. The center of the devised security mechanism relies on the RSA algorithm and this principle has been enriched with Becker’s chaotic map. This added layer of complexity and security is a groundbreaking technique for the IOT system and will make it extremely difficult for an unauthorized user to discover the actual contents of the data that the system encrypts. The presented application was designed with deep attention applied to its implementation using MATLAB 2021b(with image processing toolbox) as this tool embraces enhanced computational and mathematical computations to ensure the encryption process is efficient and effective. Application is divided into the main one which is the main program that is responsible for the encryption process and other programs which are sub- functions. These sub- functions function synergistically to make certain that the utilization and protection of data through the application is conceivable, and in addition, it utilizes those sub-functions to test and evaluate the application that proposed. The Application contains:

• Main Code: this code do the encryption and decryption processes using (RSA) Based on Baker Chaotic Map.

• Baker Map Function: this function do scrambling for the image through change the pixel of the images.

• Inverse Baker Map: this function do unscrambling for image in order to restore the image.

• Entropy Function: this function is used to calculate the entropy for original image and
encrypted image.

• Calculate NPCR function: this function is used to calculate the Average percentage change in pixels.

• Calculate UACI function: this function is used to Calculates the average intensity of the absolute differences between the two images.

• ChiSquare Function: This function is used to measures the difference between two distributions (histograms) of pixels.

• Correlation Function: this function is used to find the correlation between vertical and horizontal adjacent pixel.

• Test Baker Map Function: this function is used to test the baker map.
